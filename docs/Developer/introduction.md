# Introduction
There were so many things I was going to write about here regarding developing applications with Composer. More information about how to run a business network in development mode, using the simulator rather than a real fabric for really fast rapid application development. Advice about not to use OR's in queries as they cannot be indexed etc. 

Unfortunately now as composer isn't moving forward now and there was some work required to make it ready for production use (with an understanding of the limiting factors within composer and fabric node.js support) so unfortunately this book is never going to be started :-(
