# Introduction
There were so many things I was going to write about here regarding developing applications with Composer. More information about how to run a business network in development mode, using the simulator rather than a real fabric for really fast rapid application development. Advice about not to use OR's in queries as they cannot be indexed etc. 

Unfortunately now as composer isn't moving forward now and there was some work required to make it ready for production use (with an understanding of the limiting factors within composer and fabric node.js support) so unfortunately this book is not going to be done :-(

I have done 2 sections people may find useful and are in the table of contents about how to do rapid development while using a real fabric. This addresses the issue where making changes to a business network and having to change the version then perform a fabric upgrade (which could take a couple of minutes) was one of the problems many users experienced. The other is about the experimental simulator feature. Both provide environment to help accelerate the development of business networks.
