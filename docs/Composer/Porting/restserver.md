# Rest Server
Unfortunately there is no generic rest server that can generate an API based on your deployed chaincode. You will need to create your own. 

The fabric sample balance-transfer includes a node express app providing a rest api, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/balance-transfer)
