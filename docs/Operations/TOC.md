- Things that need to be included
  - Misc
     - Need to note about identity activation
     - client version mismatch with runtime version
     - version migration ????
     - commands that create cards for you and the issues there
     - CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT
     - fabric-ca-client with tls issues     
  - Docker Images
     - No included diagnostic tools
     - removed ability to install anything else for security reasons
     - based on alpine
     - issues if you copy binaries to it
     - CLI, Playground, Rest Server
     - why you might not want to use the images as is
     - PM2 is used to try to ensure reliability
  - Rest Server
     - discovery id used for system activities and bn parsing
     - it only uses the cloud wallet
     - explorer and how to disable
     - examples of identity management using it
     - Multi-user and authentication go hand in hand
     - uploaded cards are not stored in the cloud wallet
     - in-memory and mongodb
     - The REST server can be configured to authenticate clients. When this option is enabled, clients must authenticate to the REST server before they are permitted to call the REST API.
     - Mult-user: By default, the Hyperledger Composer REST server services all requests by using the Blockchain identity specified on the command line at startup. requires authentication setup.
     - APIKey
  - Diagnostics
     - CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT
     - CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING
     - CORE_PEER_LOGGING
     - orderer logging
     - ca server logging
  - cloud wallets
    - wallet to hold sensitive info such as cards, connector info eg fabric keystore for keys & certs
    - can share a wallet through filesystem sharing, remote server
    - danger with fabric-ca admin if you store card with a secret, if 2 people use it at the same time, 2 enrollments can occur
