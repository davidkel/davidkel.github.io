# The rise and fall of hyperledger fabric, my personal thoughts
Hyperledger fabric started out as a large collaborative project. Lots of different companies working together to deliver a open source permissioned blockchain implementation. Today the only participant is IBM (with a few small contributions from IBM customers or ex-IBMers, eg Jay) but really it is an IBM owned project and it's IBM who have single handedly killed the collaboration and the community.

I work for IBM on hyperledger fabric and I have little visibility of the planning that is being done so how on earth do the community know. Do they know IBM is working on producing a fabric K8s operator for hyperledger fabric to go first into the labs and then become the defacto standard for deploying fabric networks ?

Let's talk about IBM in the community then. Do the maintainers bother with the community ? Well DaveE does a small amount and Yacov makes a good effort as does Mark Lewis, but what about the others ? AndyC does F all, as does Manish. JamesT only when on an internal community support Rota along with Matthew. How about Ale, Artem, Senthil (Who should be retired as a maintainer) who don't bother. Discord/RC has very few responses from maintainers, Stackoverflow goes unanswered and some mailing questions do get responses.

Another real embaressment is the 2022 mentorship program. I am a caliper maintainer and there are only 2 of us yet we have 2 mentorship projects approved. Fabric onlu has a couple and one of them is specific to the fabric sdks, the other is interopability neither of which came from any of the main fabric developers (who are all IBM). This is a pretty pathetic situation and really goes to show that Fabric has and always will be a secret IBM project that just happen to publish the source to. Funny that 2 other projects are about K8s operators for fabric, but no one knows that there is a plan to provide a K8s operator into hyperledger for fabric and that it's not a collaboration with other like minded people who have also produced k8s operators. Why is IBM open sourcing a K8s operator for business reasons of course to try to get people to buy it's support offering and so it has to align with the IBP product. If IBM wanted to collaborate it didn't make much of an effort to create a community around it (JoshK).
