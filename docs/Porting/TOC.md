This is a living document so will change over time so worth checking back.
There is also a sample showing conversion of the trade-network bna to the new programming models using typescript and can found at [https://github.com/davidkel/bnaport](https://github.com/davidkel/bnaport) . This is also a living entity so will be improved over time
