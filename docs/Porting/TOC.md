# Hyperledger Composer Porting Guide version 0.1.4

## Changes
- [0.1.4] improved information around queries, acls, serialisation and logging
- [0.1.3] fabric-network 1.4.2 now has support for event listening. Updated guide and sample to reflect this.

This is a living document so will change over time so worth checking back.
There is also a sample showing conversion of the trade-network bna to the new programming models using typescript and can found at [https://github.com/davidkel/bnaport](https://github.com/davidkel/bnaport) . This is also a living entity so will be improved over time
