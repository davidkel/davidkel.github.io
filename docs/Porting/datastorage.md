This section covers the data structure and data keys as well as the meta-data composer uses when storing information around the definitions both in the applications model definitions and also the system model.

The section will help you keep working with existing information, it will show the metadata that is included with the data that is stored with a recommendation on which ones to keep. Plus it will explain the composite keys used so you can access your data. It will also include the metadata composite keys that are created which you can either make us of, delete or leave alone.
