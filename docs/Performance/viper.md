Viper
===
-. Viper needs more rest apis to make it more helpful
-. Need to submit current changes (?????)
-. Viper and resource utilisation
-. Viper and prometheus metrics
-. Build and test new go chaincode
-. Can I just post a file again to replace or do I need to delete the thing that holds it first - YES YOU CAN ON SOME (others may perform a check to say it's already there) - It should really fail for a POST but be allowed for a PUT
-. test if I can have a ccp that have 2 peers from org1 where 2 channels have a completely different peer joined to it, ie peer 1 --> channel1, peer2 --> channel2 but I want it to work (BUT IT DOESN'T)

TODO
------
-. Can I override a failed single submission if I resubmit ? I think I can but can't remember, what if it's still listed as running ?
-. node SDK 2 timeouts not honoured in connection profile
-. what exactly are the timeouts ? 30s endorsement (appears to not timeout in that time), 5 mins waiting for a commit
